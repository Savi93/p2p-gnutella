# P2P Gnutella-based

In our project we implemented a console-based peer-to-peer application used for exchanging every type of digital content between peers by adopting a special version of the decentralized Gnutella protocol; the application was written by using the high level programming language Python.
The tool uses 3 different Sockets at 3 different ports in order to:
- Send and receive JSON-based query, query-hit, ping and pong messages (UDP);
- Send a local content after an upcoming download request (TCP);
- Download digital content from one of the peers (TCP).

Technologies used: Python (Multi-Threading, Sockets)
